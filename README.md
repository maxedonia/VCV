*Tip: Altering the playback parameters of the Lomas Sampler will create new textures in the low end. A larger start/stop playback window will generate more bass tones, whereas a shorter window will trigger more tom fills during playback.*

*Tip: Changing the parameters in the gold box shown here. A larger window means more bass tones and sample presence, a shorter window means more chopped sample playback and more tom fills.*
